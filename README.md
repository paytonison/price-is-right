# Price Is Right Prototype

This repository contains my first coding prototype. The original version was written in C++ and later converted to Python for easier experimentation.

The program simulates a simplified version of the bidding game from the television show **The Price Is Right**. Four contestants place bids on a randomly chosen item, and the contestant who comes closest without going over wins the round.

## Running the Game

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 game.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter each contestant's bid. After all bids are entered, the script reveals the actual price and announces the winning contestant or that everyone overbid.

## Files

- `game.py` &mdash; Main Python script implementing the game logic.
- `README.md` &mdash; This guide.

Enjoy, and good luck bidding!
